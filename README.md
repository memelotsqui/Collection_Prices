## Sales support fully on chain with Solana

This app allows users to create collection for digital assets, by defining prices and token currency. Only collection owner may udpate or change the prices with the collection address once its created.
When any user wants to make a purchase, prices are taken from collection prices, adds royalties, and displays final price to the user. Purchased assets will be stored on chain in a bitmask array for that specific user.

## Typescript code coming soon

This is still work in progress, and on testing phase, but once uploaded I will be creating an ap to manage collections easier on web.
